# About me
I'm Zhiren. When studying in Australia, Aussies tend to call me **Ziren** and some of my ex colleagues call me **Leon**. On the Internet I often use **errenil**, pronounced as "error nil". The pronoun is he/him.

I'm mostly interested in the following subjects (in no particular order):
- GNU/Linux (mainly Arch, Gentoo, NixOS and occasionally, Fedora)
- Emacs (along with some editor-specific things)
- (Functional) Programming Languages, Compilers, Type and Category Theory
- Blockchains (Solana, Sui) and decentralized Web3 applications
- Web technologies (Deno, Node.js, TypeScript, CSS, Standard Web APIs, etc)
- Distributed Systems and Cloud Computing (DevOps and in particular AWS)
- Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)
- Skateboard (out of practice for too long, alas)
- Learning Japanese/Korea and improving English
- Reading long in-depth reports published on *The New Yorker*
- Watching (some) K-Drama TV series

# About this site
Previously the site was built with [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/). After my old domain expired, I planed to migrate my site to a new domain with a new SSG.

This time, I want to have one that lives closer to the Web ecosystem so that I can conveniently hack the DOM. Now it runs on [Lume](https://lume.land/). The thing that I'm mostly satisfied with the current site is the use of [vanilla CSS](https://github.com/Linerre/linerre.github.io/blob/master/content/css/main.css) (no pre-, post- or whatever-CSS). I hope you find the site fast and responsive. After all, it contains only HTML and CSS, free of JavaScript[^1].

You might have noticed I did not include my LinkedIn footprint on this site.  I particularly do not like it much. It constantly implies I should pay for  improved visibility; It spams me with unsolicited messages from agents I have absolutely no connection with; In its passport-issuing countries (for verification), it doesn't list China (but there is Hong Kong), so I can't even verify my account. The UI is messy and ads are almost everywhere. Exercise: try to navigate to the place where you can manage your resumes (hint: not possible on mobile). Its job-matching algorithm is of low quality: once it pushed a notification saying I'm a top applicant for Australian Federal Police (of course it wants me to pay for better accuracy). That said, I *rule out* LinkedIn on my site, for good.

As the migration is in process and the site is undergoing reconstruction, more will be coming.

[^1]: Should I fail to enable theme-toggling later or I want to add a few interactive stuff to the site, then expect a pinch of JavaScript
