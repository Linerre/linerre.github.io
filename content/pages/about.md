# about me
I'm Zhiren Lin. When studying in Australia, Aussies tend to call me **Ziren** and some of my friends/mates prefer just **Lin**. On the Internet I often use **errenil**, pronounced as "error nil".

I'm mostly interested in the following subjects:
- GNU/Linux (Arch, Gentoo, NixOS)
- Emacs (along with some editor-specific things)
- Programming Languages and Compilers
- Blockchain and decentralized Web3 applications
- Web technologies (Deno, Node.js, TypeScript, CSS, Browser APIs, etc)
- Distributed Systems and Cloud Computing (I'm learning AWS)
- Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)
- Skateboard (out of practice for too long, alas)
- Learning Japanese/Korea and improving English
- Reading long in-depth reports published on *The New Yorker*
- Watching (some) K-Drama TV series

# about this site
Previously the site was built with [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/), but after my old domain expired, I planed to migrate my site to a new domain with a new SSG.  Now it runs on [Lume](https://lume.land/). The aspect that I'm mostly satisfied with the current site is the use of vanilla CSS (no pre-, post- or whatever-CSS, just CSS). As the migration is in process and the site is undergoing reconstruction, expect more.
